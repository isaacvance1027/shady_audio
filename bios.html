He began his career at Dog House Music Studio in Lafayette, Colorado, working alongside John Remington. There, he contributed to multiple records including Dayshaper, Liontortoise's debut EPs, Rhamakandra’s Live Session (during COVID), Mosaic Lemonade, Sempar, Big Pinch, Mr. Knobs, and other local artists from the Denver/Boulder area.</p></br>
        <p>Ty also produced Shady Oaks, served as assistant engineer on Shady’s debut MAD album, and tracked/recorded Dyin’ and Tequila during his mentorship. He is now the engineer for all future Shady Oaks releases starting in 2025. Additionally, Ty has learned under Loren Dorland at Mighty Fine Productions, assisting on various sessions and live sound events for large stages and festivals. He was also a rehearsal engineer for Tyler Childers and Trevor Hall ahead of their 2021 Red Rocks performances.</p></br>
        <p>Fluent in multiple DAWs, Ty works proficiently with Pro Tools, Logic, Ableton, and Universal Audio's LUNA. He typically tracks sessions in Pro Tools before transferring them to LUNA for mixing but is flexible to adapt to the artist's preferred workflow. Ty excels in experimenting with unconventional engineering techniques and is dedicated to capturing the perfect tone for every instrument. Whether helping to find the ideal guitar sound or offering gear from his extensive collection, he ensures that every project at Shady Audio starts fresh—without templates—allowing for a truly unique result.</p>
